          I like water sports, kayaking or Sup-boarding, I also really like
          outdoor activities (tourism).

          Before the start of covid, the greatest pleasure was traveling with
          friends to other countries. We visited Poland, Hungary, Austria,
          Belgium and other countries. It was really cool! <br />
          When everything is over, I want to start actively traveling again.

          active and funny.
