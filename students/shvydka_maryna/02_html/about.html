              My name is Maryna Shvydka, I am from the city of Lubny, Poltava
              region.From 2010-2016, I studied at Taras Shevchenko University at

          <p>
            I currently work in a private laboratory as a flow cytometry
            specialist. With the help of flow cytometry, I find out the state of
            a person's immune system and diagnose oncohematological diseases. I
            want to change the field of activity due to a complete lack of
            prospects.
